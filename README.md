# Intro
This is just an example to build a portfolio of personal exercises, not meant for public use, and just a useful tool for myself.
Simple tool using ffmpeg via ffmpeg-python to clip short videos and audios

## Usage
```bash
main.py input_file output_file --from <starting time> --to <ending time> [--speed <speed>] [--resize <new size for video>]
```
- Beware, specifying a speed will remove audio, personal preference as I don't want weird-pitch audio
